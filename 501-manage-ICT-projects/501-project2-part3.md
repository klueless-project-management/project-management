## Scenario

It is now a week before the development is due to commence according to your project plan. You have received a call from Alison Garmen, the IT Manager from WizBiz, advising the project servers will not be available for another two weeks, which includes your development server.

In addition to the above, you have just been told that a possible integration with some banking software needs to be discussed and two members of your team called in sick today.

You have decided you need to:

- Locate a temporary environment to commence development – possibly the developers’ workstations
- Initiate a meeting to find out more about the potential interface
- Incur delays due to the ill staff; you estimate two days each.
- Update your project plan (from Assessment 1 Part 5) using the project management software tool to reflect the changes outlined in the scenario.
  - This may include the Gantt chart, Communication plan, quality plan, risk register, tasks and costs. You will also need to create an issues log.
