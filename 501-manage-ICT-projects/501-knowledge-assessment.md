## Part 1: Short answer questions


1. Explain the difference between consultation and communication in the context of project management.

- **Consultation** is the process of two-way communication between the project manager and end-users or domain experts. The goal of consultation is to elicit requirements, constraints, risks and edge cases.
- **Communication** is about information sharing during the project, example: are we going to have daily standup, will we do zoom collaborations for knowledge gathering sessions or will we use emails.

2. Outline and evaluate at least three methods of communication and consultation that you would use within a project management framework, including interviewing techniques.

**Consultation**

- Brainstorming is where you get a range of domain experts or end users in a room to come up with ideas that pull from the expertise of people with different points of view.
- Check sheet (tally sheet) provides a structured way to collect data about a potential issues, this information a can be tallied and helps determine if a feature needs to be addressed.
- Interviews are used to elicit information from stakeholders directly. Interviewing experienced project participants or domain experts can help in identifying requirements, risks, constraints, acceptance criteria, legal issues, quality needs and expectations.


**Communication**

- **Project Organization Chart** is a tool to outline who is on the project. This helps determine the who’s who of the project.
- **Project Calendar** provides a dated list of the major events of the project. Kick-off Meetings, major milestones, known deadlines.
- **Daily Standup** - allow project participants to sync in real time and discuss the progress and the barriers.

3. Describe the following communication styles and the strategies you could use when communicating or consulting with people on a project.

|**Communication style**|**Description**|**Strategies**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Passive**| This style is used by people who avoid expressing their opinions or feelings, protecting their rights, and identifying and meeting their needs. | The people need to feel safe, they do not respond to overly hurtful or anger inducing situations. When in group setting ask them directly for their opinion, edify them in front of others if their contribution is helpful,  One on one communication is useful to illicit information from them, make them fell safe and heard |
|**Aggressive**| People using this communication style express their feelings, opinions and advocate their needs in a way that violates the rights of others, it can even be abusive or frightening. | Initiate calm one on one communication to avoid the individual being shamed in front of others, listen to the person, acknowledgement their point of view and the steer them towards other points of view, in a group setting, make it clear that team contribution is needed and then turn to someone else and ask for contribution |
|**Passive-Aggressive**| Individuals appear passive on the surface but are acting out anger in subtle, indirect, behind-the-scenes ways. They feel powerless, stuck, and resentful | Ask their opinions and if appropriate, edify them in front of colleges, this is about them being heard and building esteem |
|**Assertive**| This is a style in which individuals clearly state their opinions and feelings, and firmly advocate for their rights and needs without violating the rights of others. These individuals value themselves, their time, and their emotional, spiritual, and physical needs and are strong advocates for themselves while being very respectful of the rights of others. | Easy to communicate and work with these people but let them know about boundaries. ie. other people need to be heard. |

5. Describe the characteristics of both leaders and technical teams and explain how they contribute to effective teamwork in ICT projects.

|**Role**|**Characteristics**|**How they contribute to effective teamwork**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Leader**| Intelligent, Leads by good example, reads people, has awareness of cliques and emotions, has awareness of process and goals | The leader sees the bigger picture, they can understand that the impact of one person or process can effect other people or deliveries, they read their people and communicate with effectively by matching commination style, the delegate effectively but do not shirk responsibility |
|**Technical team**| Intelligent, Focussed Individuals, Mostly Specialists with some generalists | A good technical team will have some people with a specific specialties that others lean on and generalists (sometimes tech leads) that get the job done with out getting bogged down in detail, a good tech team requires a leader that can manage the personalities, engineering teams in particular can often have insecure, aggressive and sometimes spectrum based people that can be awesome, but also irate others if not managed well. |

6. Analyse and explain the process of establishing technical teams.

Think carefully about what you want, what projects are active or starting soon.
Ensure that you team members have experience and the correct certifications.
Put a lot of effort into finding a good tech lead. Make sure the tech lead has good interpersonal skills.
The tech lead needs to be part of the decision process for team members (its their team).
Keep the team engaged, they need to feel like they are learning and using interesting technology if you want to keep them.
Put effort into developing an empowering and growth oriented work culture.
Diversity is good, gender, thinking processes, personalities, ethnicity.

7. Analyse and explain the stages of team development.

This information is based on workl by Bruce Tuckman, an educational psychologist, who published his findings in a paper titled Developmental Sequence in Small Groups in 1965.

**Forming** - Team members come together to meet, it is a period of orientation. There is often a period of excitement and weight, sometimes the group dynamics and roles have yet to be established, a team leader will typically emerge and take charge and direct the individual members.
**Storming** - This is the stage of conflict, personality rubbing, cliques are forming, different opinions on technology, strategy and goals, plus personal agendas.
**Norming** - Team members have figured out how to work together, unity is developing, people are bonding, people become familiar with personality traits.
**Performing** - People are happy and excited and team performance is high. There is stability and adaptability to emerging problems.
**Adjourning** - This is a stage of closure and often times mourning, there is a time to reflect on accomplishments and major milestones and the personal contributions of individuals.


8. Evaluate the processes that can be used for monitoring your own as well as the team performance within a project and explain how they are used for monitoring.

**Observation** - Reflect on you own processes and emotions, Watch how employees interact, what distracts them, what brings them into focus, time of day that they are productive, when are they not.
**One on One** - Regular one-on-one, ask the team member to account for what they have done, concrete actions. Keep a diary of refer to past meetings so that you can coach them in regards to growth strategies.
**Self Monitoring tools** - For yourself and for your team, encourage the use of productivity tools, checklist list, Ghant charts, noise canceling headphones, pomodoro technique, activity logs, time logs. ~~Secret hidden big brother cam~~


9.  Explain how team roles and delegation would differ within a multi-project methodology context, compared to a single project.

**Single project teams** can go deep with specialization in terms of technology and roles/responsibilities. Suited to people that have longer term focus, and love honing there skills in a specialty or are happy with routine, There is a focus on improving the system reliability.

Often specific roles emerge and people pass of work that belongs to another person (based on role)
People often work in isolation on their part of the system

Multi  project teams need to have more of a generalist point of view, they need to adapt to technology quickly, for example programmers who do this are often strong in patterns and can be Polyglot developers, There is a focus on project closure.

People need to adapt and take on any task.
People can often work in pairings and these parings can be fluid so that the team constantly up-skills across disciplines.

10. Analyse and explain what the techniques of *estimation* and *cost analysis* are and why you would use them when managing a project.

**Estimation** is a rough calculation in terms of price, resources and time. Estimation is should work within a specific scope, with constraints and assumptions. Estimation requires an experienced person to be accurate, but note, estimations are rarely accurate because of unknown factors arising.
**Cost analysis** in project management is designed to assess the cost compared to the benefits in the project proposal.

Is the project worth doing? The difference between the cost and the benefits will determine whether the action is worth it or not.
Often times, if the cost is 50% of the benefits and the amortization period is not more than one year, it is worth taking action.


11.  Summarise and evaluate at least three estimation techniques.

**Analogous Estimation** is based on how similar past projects performed, their costs, durations and deliverability. Use this technique if the comparison projects were successful in terms of deliverability and cost/benefits and project accuracy.

**Bottom-up Estimation** is based on estimating each task, individually, starting from the very bottom to the resulting goal. This technique assumes you know the project outcome which in Agile environments can only be applied for small projects. This process is good for seeing the bigger picture and forcing you really take a step back and think thoroughly about what is required to successfully complete the project and to be sure that the larger goal makes sense.

**Parametric Estimation** is based on estimates using detailed data from previous activities and uses the relationship between variables to estimate the cost and duration of your current project. This technique requires robust data and can be skewed if you don't understand and apply all the different variables.


12.  Summarise and evaluate at least two cost analysis techniques.

**Lifecycle Cost Analysis** helps to calculate the total cost of ownership, this style of analysis can useful when the project is about developing infrastructure and/or assets costs that will be used for a period of time. This is often used when comparing complementary but competing solutions.

**Cost/Benefit Aalysis** is when you want to compare cost of development vs revenue generated. This is often expressed as a payback period of time or return on investment.


13.  Identify at least three project-management methods or techniques and describe each method and its characteristics.

|**Project management method / technique**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
| Waterfall | This is a linear technique where a project is split up in sequential stages and each stage depends on the completion of a prior one. This technique doesn’t allow much room for unexpected changes and assumes a well know delivery path. |
| Kanban | Projects are broken up into individual action items. There is often a backlog of tasks that are can be reordered as needed and a set of in progress tasks (known as cards, tickets or stories) that are sitting in a delivery pipeline which can be simple such as (To Do, Doing, and Done) or with additional pipeline steps added as needed |
|||

14. Identify at least two types of project-management tools and describe each tool and its characteristics.

|**Project management tool**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
| Kanban Chart | A Kanban chart is a tool that shows tasks (cards) that are assigned to different developers and these cards are in different parts of a workflow, a basic workflow would include (todo, doing, done) but could also be (backlog, todo, in progress, on staging, awaiting deploy, deploying, complete) |
| Ghant Chart | A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, it provides a view of schedule, dependant tasks, parallel tasks, resource assigned to task, milestone estimates |

15. Analyse the key features of the systems development life cycle (SDLC) phases.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.

The phases are as follows: 

**Requirement analysis** - What problems need to be solved and develop a list of requirements using consultation, business analysis, customer interviews and other input mechanisms.
**Planning** - Create a plan of what the client wants to achieve and order this list base on a mixture of (dependency, riskiness and what the client really really wants)
**Software design such as architectural design** - Build various models including C4 context diagrams, swimlane data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, technology stack evaluation, scalability and availability requirements.
**Software development** - Develop the software on the selected stack, and building out the application, libraries, sub-systems based on the requirements and the architectural models, whilst following common software patterns and applying consistency via linting.
**Testing** - Unit tests are created during development, whilst integration and user acceptance tests are also utilized.
**Deployment** - Continuous integration, automated deployment scripting, delploy to custom environments (production, production/region, staging, testing), database migrations, ETL's, (services/queues/event handlers)

16. Compare at least two current systems development methodologies. Your answer must include the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology.

|**Methodology**|**Comparison**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| Agile | Teams use agile methodology to minimize risk (bugs, cost overruns, requirement changes). Teams develop software in mini-iterations with new functionality being delivered regular. User feedback is constantly used to adapt the software. | Fast start to the project.<br>Adapt to customer feedback.<br>Adapt to unexpected issues.<br>New sub-systems, services, routes are relatively straight forward to implement.| Not clear on future outcome, but you can work to a vision.<br>Subsystem are not always thought through as part of a bigger picture.<br>Technical debt can accumulate quickly.|
| RAD | Rapid application development is a condensed development process that produces a high-quality system with low investment costs. RAD process allows our developers to quickly adjust to shifting requirements in a fast-paced and constantly changing market | Development is driven by templates<br>Many Sub-systems and components can be built quickly.<br>MVC and Prototypes can be built on demand | Too much wasted code is often built<br/>Can be difficult to adapt code as templates need to be altered and code compares need to be reviewed. <br> Must use a very experienced architect and lead developer for success<br>Team must be all on board or this technique fails |
