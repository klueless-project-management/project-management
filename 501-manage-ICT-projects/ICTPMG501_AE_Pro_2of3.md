Refer to the scenario documents and Organisation standards in Assessment 1.

Download and unzip the resource folder (Cl_ProjMgt_AE_Pro_SR1.zip) to access documents referred to in this assessment.


## **Part 1: Commence the project**
Refer to Assessment Checklist 1 for the criteria for this part.

There are several tasks that must be done before assembling and meeting your team. For each of the following, create a separate word-processed document:

1. Create a logically-sequenced team document for the following, using appropriate language and grammar:
2. Prepare a statement of team values and expected behaviour that are in line with the organisational values. Note that this will be part of what will used to monitor the team members’ performance in the project.
3. Select three suitable team members for the IT development project team (refer to Appendix 1 for the developer personas), justifying your selections.
4. Allocate the project roles listed in the Developer team job descriptions (ROI_Developer_team_job_descriptions.pdf) and responsibilities based on the requirements of the recommended project solution (as identified in the project plan in Assessment 1 Part 5.5) and the team member’s strengths. You may create a table/matrix for this information.
4. Some team members may need training or support, which will be determined in the team meeting. So that you can assist them, you need to build your networks of key people and communities with expert skills and knowledge.
5. Include details of at least two networks that could be utilised for staff training and upskilling. These may include meetup groups, LinkedIn, or other sources of expertise. Provide screenshots and/or emails (both sent and replied) of your interactions with these networks.
6. Write an email to Alison Garmen, the IT Manager from WizBiz, to invite her to be part of your professional network and discuss how she could be of help with supporting the team. Use the [ROI email template](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/items/73f2bb48-c457-4fe9-96cf-618ee5f5f2bc/0/?attachment.uuid=347d5a5d-e8a0-4085-9966-52c261b042de) (ROI_Email_template.docx).


## **Part 2: Consult with your team**
Now that you have selected your team, you will need to meet with them in a role play of 15-20 minutes to discuss the project and their roles and responsibilities.

Your team will consist of 3-4 people (including yourself).

Your assessor will observe the role play and complete Observation Checklist 1.

During the meeting you must:

- actively listen and contribute to the discussion.

Role play participants:

- Team members – arrange for at least two other people to act as the team members.
- Project Manager (this is you).

## **Part 3: Monitor and control the project**
Refer to Assessment Checklist 2 for the criteria for this part.

It is now a week before the development is due to commence according to your project plan. You have received a call from Alison Garmen, the IT Manager from WizBiz, advising the project servers will not be available for another two weeks, which includes your development server.

In addition to the above, you have just been told that a possible integration with some banking software needs to be discussed and two members of your team called in sick today.

You have decided you need to:

- locate a temporary environment to commence development – possibly the developers’ workstations
- initiate a meeting to find out more about the potential interface
- incur delays due to the ill staff; you estimate two days each.
1. 1. Update your project plan (from Assessment 1 Part 5) using the project management software tool to reflect the changes outlined in the scenario. This may include the Gantt chart, communication plan, quality plan, risk register, tasks and costs. You will also need to create an issues log.

**Note: The project plan may be several documents which will need to be compiled as necessary.**

**If there have been no changes, the specific document would not need to be updated.**

**The Gantt chart must be submitted in both the format it was created in and as a PDF.**
**

## **Part 4: Manage your team**

Team member 1 has been coming into team meetings late and not prepared, as well as taking a sick day at least once a week, which may affect the project timeline.

Team member 2 has occasionally updated documents locally without updating them in the team repository. This has caused problems with version control.

Participate in two role plays of 5-10 minutes each to manage the performance of these two team members.

Make sure that you actively listen and contribute to the discussions.

1. 1. current issues and strategies to mitigate these issues, where possible
1. 1. any changes to the project and their impact on the original approved project plan.


## **Part 6: Hand over the project**
Refer to Assessment Checklist 4 for the criteria for this part.

The hand over activities include documenting the project for the ICT staff and the client. Review and analyse the project documentation to write or update the following reports and documentation.

Your reports must:
