What is a Project Charter as researched by David

- Summary of problems or opportunities
- Project scope, overview of the work that will be achieved
  - Will deliverables be at once or in phases
  - List what is in and out of scope for the project
- Risks and Assumptions
  - What risks could affect the project
  - Document all assumptions
  - Such as size of development team
- Definition of Success
  - Look at the objectives, opportunities and benefits
  - Success criteria should be measurable
- Project milestones
  - High level summary of the major pieces of work
    - Epics or Initiatives
- Benefits
  - Quantify, e.g. how many hours of employee time will be saved and convert to moneytary value over a year
  - Unquantified, it's important to understand unquantified benefits as well
- Solution Options
  - Each with: Summary, Risk, Assumptions, Ongoing Costs, Rough order of magnitude estimate
  - Highlight the recommend solution
- Rough order of magnitude (ROM Estimate)
  - Guess at all in effort
  - +- 50% based on high level discovery
  - 200 hours on a project means that you can see between 100 and 300 hours being needed for this project
- ROI, Payback Period and Value Proposition
  - ROI = difference between benefits amount and cost of project
  - Payback Period = How long to pay for itself
  - This creates the value Proposition
- Project Team and Stakeholders
  - Executive sponsor (champion)
  - 1 stakeholder per functional area, e.g. HR, Finance, IT, Sales
- Stakeholder sign-off
