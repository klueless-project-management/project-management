### Executive summary

In communication sessions with WizBiz execs, they expressed a desire to handle increased competition, scale their customer base and 10x their business.

The existing model of brick and mortar stores, whilst profitable, come with large investment, slow ROI and don't scale.

New local and overseas competitors are increasing market share because of there online only approach with low overhead and high margin.

We have decided to enter the online only space, whilst maintaining the benefits of our existing brick and mortar businesses and brand equity.

### Overview

Design, develop and implement the WizBiz shopping portal.

Cut costs associated with the existing brick and mortar stores and open up to larger market of customers.

### Feasibility

Project feasibility areas:

**Technical capability**

WizBiz currently have in house team including IT manager, networking staff, application support staff and a wordpress webmaster.

ROI has internal development team including web developer, technical writer, content developers and systems analyst.

**Financial resources**

Budget for the project is $150,000.00. 

This is just for the web portal, there are additional budges for hardware, support and maintenance and telecommunications.

**Legal requirements**


The system will store details of customers and those required for e-commerce purposes. The business must comply with all relevant standards and requirements under law in Australia with regards to the personal information and payment details.

Web portal will require the following:

- Have a Privacy Policy 
- Have a Terms and Conditions
- Collect only personal information required to deliver our services
- Have Privacy Compliance System in place with ability to securely destroying information that is not used in a "reasonable" amount of time

[Australian Guidelines for eCommerce](https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-03/australian_guidelines_for_electronic_commerce.pdf)

**Operational**

The WizBiz portal provides a new avenue for marketing existing products and services.

We already have phone and email sales team, accounting and payment systems, warehousing and delivery / logistics operations in place.

The WizBiz portal is just a layer on top of these existing business operations.

**Scheduling**

Below is a simple schedule, see the project plan and ghant for more detail

- Build a project plan
- Identify required resources
- Hire any identified external contractors
- Execute on the project plan
- Deploy the system
- Run User Acceptance Testing using internal staff and preferred customers
- Open up for general access

### Business requirements

Implement a shopping portal that allows WizBiz to handle increased competition, scale their customer base and 10x their business.

### Options

The team currently has a good idea of what an in-house solution would look and has evaluated a solution from a one of our smaller competitors `PureBiz Inc`

Using ideas from that solution plus our own in house requirements, we know clearly what is needed.

We have considered approaching `PureBiz Inc`, for either licencing or even trying to acquire them outright, but those idea is on hold.

We have looked at off the shelf solutions from Magneto and Shopify, but we realize much of the solution requires tight integration with existing brick and mortar and logistics systems that are already developed internally.
