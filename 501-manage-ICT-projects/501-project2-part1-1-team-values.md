Cooperate with one another. Support your team objective, co-create where appropriate, share your knowledge.

**Constructive Critique**

This team is a safe place, you can voice your opinion, but hold your judgement

**Ego Outside**

Leave your Ego at the door, we all have important contributions and selfish gains will disrupt the team goals.

**Energetic And Enthusiastic**

You may not be a leader, but never mind, our team needs your fire and energy. Dare to implement plans devised by you, the team has your back.

**Empathy**

Life happens, be aware of team mate challenges. Learn to connect with fellow team members. Empathy means putting yourself in their shoes, connection builds respect and effective relationships.

**Integrity**

High professionalism, personal standards and behaviour will strengthen the team. Be sincere in your opinions and dealing with other team members. Focus on trust and let go of gossip and back stabbing.

**Safety First**

Treat each other with courtesy and respect, be sensitive to cultural backgrounds, make it clear that objectification and harassment has no place on our team. Say no to aggression, discrimination and bullying.
