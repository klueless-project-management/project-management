## Prepare to gather data

Refer to Assessment Checklist 2 for the criteria for this part.

You do not have much experience as a project manager, so you will need to perform some research and plan your activities.

Review, research and analyse the supplied organisational documentation and other sources of relevant information.

Create an information gathering plan in a word-processed document that includes the following:

1. Plan at least four suitable information gathering activities that will help you to determine the project requirements, constraints and risks.
2. Include a bibliography of resources you use for research, including organisational documentation.
