### Part 6: Hand over the project

> Prepare a project handover report, which includes:

#### Initial support requirements

- System logs will be watched by Lisa McFeist/Ben Dover (Developers) will produce hotfixes for any issues that come up
- Andy Anderson (Software Tester) will be available to our internal users for guidance on how to use the system

#### Ongoing maintenance requirements.

- Support ticketing system needs to be setup with both email and in-site integration.
- 1st level support staff will need to watch for issues

#### Update disaster recovery plan

- Add Lisa McFeist/Ben Dover (Developers) with their phone numbers to the internal contact table.
- Add in a section for version rollback so that both the application and database can be rolled back to an earlier working version.
