Sally Smith and Shane Jackson, the owners of a new company WizBiz, have approached ROI to develop a system for their company.

The owners have identified a gap in the current IT market for a supply of quality IT components and peripherals available within Australia. They would like to sell a quality range of computer components and peripherals at competitive prices.

They have done an initial study of retail outlet costs (WizBiz Preliminary Retail outlet costs.xslx), however would like to look at an alternative option, an online shopping portal. The company plans to go live and start selling to the public in just six months from today.

The ROI Manager of Development, Vinh Nguyen, has asked you to manage the project for 
WizBiz. The system will be developed by ROI developers, who you will be selecting and managing for this project.

The high level scope of the project is to design, develop and implement the shopping portal. If the project is not a success, the business will fail; without the system, there is no business.

You have been provided with a summary of the functional requirements below and access to all the key members of staff as necessary to complete the project. These key members of staff have been meeting for the past two months about the business idea and what role they might play in the business. They each have a good understanding of the business needs as relevant to their role. You have been provided with additional company information and a transcript of the initial interviews with each of the key stakeholders (WizBiz scenario.docx).

### **Project brief/specifications**
The portal will be:

- designed in line with requirements that will be supplied by the key staff
- web based
- hosted internally at a primary site at head office, with a secondary site set up at the distribution centre, which is geographically separate from the head office
- highly scalable, initially supporting up to 1000 transactions a week but able to scale up to at least 50,000 transactions per week
- inclusive of the following key features:
  - Product entry and maintenance
  - Customer access
  - Shopping cart
  - E-commerce
  - Reporting

Security and privacy will be of utmost importance to the business. The system will store details of customers and those required for e-commerce purposes. The business must comply with all relevant standards and requirements under law in Australia with regards to the personal information and payment details.

WizBiz has provided you with the following documentation:

- Interview responses with management (Interview responses.docx)
- Survey results (Survey results.docx)
- Preliminary retail outlet costs (WizBiz Preliminary Retail outlet costs.xslx).

### **Organisational standards**

ROI uses the following standards:

- Business reports and documents must use the [*ROI report template*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/items/73f2bb48-c457-4fe9-96cf-618ee5f5f2bc/0/?attachment.uuid=c7103fff-d751-4918-af8a-4e44aa4f5625) (ROI_Report_template.dotx).

All IT staff members must adhere to the following:

- ROI code of conduct (ROI_Code_of_Conduct.pdf)
- [ROI New staff IT induction kit](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/items/73f2bb48-c457-4fe9-96cf-618ee5f5f2bc/0/?attachment.uuid=f3b7c4cb-18a0-481d-8b9c-0a392f5f46eb) (ROI_New_staff_IT_induction_kit.pdf)
- ROI Records management procedure (ROI_Procedure_RecordsManagement.pdf)
- ROI Communication procedure (ROI_Procedure_Communication.pdf).
