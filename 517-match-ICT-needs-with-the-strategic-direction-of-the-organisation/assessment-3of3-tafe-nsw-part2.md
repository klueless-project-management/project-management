## Scenario Based Questions


### Go-Air scenario
Go-Air is a small no frills airline with a fleet of 22 aircraft's.  It started in 2007 as a low-cost budget carrier and had been the top airline in its category.  The strategic plan 2014-2018 struggled to meet its objectives due to increased competition, lack of a customer loyalty program (that other low-cost carriers offer), increasing frequency of flight delays and customer dissatisfaction.

### **Questions**

## **Part 2: Short answer questions**


1. What would be the primary objective of an organisation’s strategic plan? 

> Include in your answer a brief description of each of the components of a strategic plan.

Mission: Quality, Service and all-in-one customisation solution.
Goals: Happy customers, recurring customers and maintain strong financial growth.
Strengths: Unlimited trailer designing, efficient workforce, great vendor support, high professional standards.
Long Term: Double sales and grow retained profits by 15% per year in 5 years through the effective use of business website.
Communication: Improve issues with aging ICT infrastructure, staff training and knowledge bases.

2. Explain how are the ICT needs of an organisation are incorporated into its strategic plan. 

> Hint: Think from the perspective of the significance of ICT in today’s business environment

ICT for Smart Trailers needs to:

Support a remote work force, especially sales and design.
Support vertical integration from customer -> design -> sale -> manufacture -> delivery -> accounts -> support. Each department needs to gather, update and query information form other teams.
Online Site to allow customers to browse, research and order
Online Tools to allow customers and designers to design bespoke solutions.

3. Gaps between the existing and required ICT systems are a reality that can have adverse effects on business operations.

> This is an example of why gap analysis is so important. What are the most commonly used gap analysis techniques?  
> Identify and briefly describe 2 techniques (One being SWOT).

Common tools include: 

- SWOT analysis
- PERT
- Nadler-Tushman congruence model
- Fishbone diagram
- McKinsey 7S model
- Burke-Litwin Change model

Gap analysis is used to compare where you are against where you would like to be:

**SWOT** analysis focuses on Strengths and Weaknesses in the internal environment and Opportunities and Threats in the external environment.
**Nadler-Tushman’s congruence model** is used to identify performance gaps within an organization. It is based on the principle that a business’s performance is a result of these 4 elements; work, people, structure and culture.



In order to answer the following question you will need to find the most recent TAFE NSW Annual Report. 
To do this go to [www.tafensw.edu.au](http://www.tafensw.edu.au) and search for ‘annual report’. 
This Annual Report will include details of TAFE NSW’s Strategic Plan and recent performance.

4. Briefly describe what is the current strategic directions for TAFE NSW? 

> In your opinion, are the objectives and strategic directions of TAFE NSW aligned to each other? Briefly describe why you believe this. 

There are four goals in the transition from `TAFE NSW` to `One TAFE`

1. Become the provider of choice for skilling the State’s workforce
2. Being a contemporary, commercial and sustainable business
3. Serve local communities
4. Develop a customer-driven, proud and productive TAFE NSW team.

Two year Operational Plan

- Responsive & connected to our customers
- Flexible & engaging place to learn and work
- Strong & sustainable organisation.

Some achievements include:

 - Provide significant support to the communities and businesses impacted by bushfire through delivery of many fee-free courses in South, North and West regions.
- Launch a Customer Experience Strategy and implemented a Customer Voice program to enable customer feedback and support improved customer experience.
- Continuation of the delivery of a real-time, whole of business, integrated student management system that will improve effectiveness and efficiency of operations
- Enhanced brand experience through continuous improvements to TAFE NSW websites and customer relationship management systems
- Launched innovative course offerings and delivery models such as the Cyber Security microlearning modules
- Women in Business online program for women looking to establish a micro or small business or already operating a business
- Developed a state-wide Multicultural Plan 2020-22 to furthering the commitment to people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
- Released a three-year Aboriginal Employment Strategy


5. Suppose you have identified a few gaps between the objectives and strategic directions of an organisation.

> Addressing these gaps will require some changes or improvements to the current ICT systems.  
> Briefly describe the effects of such changes on an organisation and how these effects can be kept to a minimum without compromising business operations.    
> (Hint: Consider how the employees will react to proposed changes and the strategies that can be considered to address any probable adverse reactions).

Current ICT systems are predominately windows based with Microsoft OS and 360 office products. Many staff and students are used to working with a wide variety of hardware and cloud based solutions that don't always play well with the TAFE ICT systems. Apple, Google, Tablets, VR and other hardware/software solutions.
Educational delivery has big competition from online providers such as Skillshare, UDemy, Google University where courses are more current, more focussed and with very little tedium (they cut to chase).


6. You need to prepare a report for management and present it to the board. 

> This report will include information about a project proposal to implement a significant change in the organisation’s ICT systems.
> How is such a professionally written report structured?  Identify and briefly describe the main components of the report.

Project: TAFEty (pronounced TAF-Et-y)

**Executive Summary**

TAFEty provides a scalable Skill sharing platform for people of NSW to access and learn new skills that can be credited against certificates and diploma courses.

**Project background**

Current course delivery is generally on-premise, lags behind industry needs, bogged down in bureaucracy for both course creation and assessment and often boring.

**Solutions and approach**

Look to successful online course providers such as Skillshare and UDemy and allow our teachers to develop digital lessons for delivery
Multiple teachers could create the same course and are paid based on recurring watch time plus course completion.
By allowing multiple teachers to create and update the same courses using a voting system, the more engaging / quality teachers will rise to the top and so courses will naturally get better and be more engaging. This is the model that works with Skillshare / Udemy.

**Conclusion**

I suggest that we open conversation up for a modern education platform that serves the NSW industry and citizens whilst taking advantage of the disruptive techniques being employed in the new digital education economy.


7. In your role as an ICT manager you have been asked to identify and evaluate external ICT systems and products that are suitable for your organisation. 

> As part of this review you will also need to re-evaluate internal ICT systems and product for their continuing suitability. 
> Explain what methods you would use to complete this task.

COVID has shown that on-site training can become useless and investment in virtual education would be a solution for COVID and a solution for student/teachers that are either not near a TAFE or the TAFE they are near does not provide the courses that they need.

We need to evaluate both existing and new virtual computing environments. 

These should include virtual desktops for staff, virtual classrooms lessons, virtual breakout rooms for team collaborations, VR platforms such as Facebook Metaverse and online course platforms such as UDemy/Skillshare.
