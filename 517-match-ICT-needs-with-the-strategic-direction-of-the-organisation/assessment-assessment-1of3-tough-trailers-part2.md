## Introduction

## Report body
  
### Background information

**Company Overview**

Tough Trailers (formerly Tough Steel) was founded in 2000 as an architectural metal fabricator, they diversified into small box trailer manufacturing in 2007. By 2010, the trailer business had grown so much that they made the decision to become a full-time trailer manufacturer and re-branded as "Tough Trailers".

Tough Trailers produces both standard and customized box trailers.

The factory and Head office is in Newcastle with showrooms in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

With 1500 customers and Turnover of \$10M, Tough Trailers has seen sales increase by 40% each year in the last two years.

**Customers**

Customers range from home handyman to horse owners, trade persons, serious off-roaders and a variety of motor sports people

Trailers come in a variety of styles, including small box trailer \$1,000, to utility trailers and customised trailers.

Custom trailers include horse floats, off-road, car or bike carriers in ranging from \$1,300 to over \$10,000.

The custom trailers have become more popular recently, particularly with trades persons and motor sports people.

**Problems**

The company internal systems and computer systems have worked well in the past, but with the increase in sales, they realize that they may not be able to cope with continued expansion.

The main ares of concern are:

- The Designer/Estimator liaises with Manufacturing to obtain quotes for the customised trailers.
  - Quotes for custom trailers are taking too long.
  - The customers love the unlimited design scope, but waiting on quotes from manufacturer is loosing business.

- Sales catalogues are very basic
- Showrooms only hold a limited number of demonstration items.
- There is not gallery of past custom trailers that have been built in the past.
- Customers want to be able to see more examples of the types of customised trailers that can be produced.

**Future Strategies**

- A determined push into the customised trailer market with provision for people who want some individualisation of their trailers.
- Producing a range of modular components that can be volume manufactured.
- Expand their sales outlets through the opening of dealerships, possibly using a franchise model (this has not yet been evaluated, but maybe persued later).
- Create a website to provide information about standard and customised trailers
  - Online catalogue.
  - Sell directly to customers through online ordering. 
  - Integrate with their current systems for payments.
  - Easy content management
  - Budget of \$30,000 for the website, which can be completed in two stages.
