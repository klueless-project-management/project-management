## Introduction

## Report body
  
### Background information

**Company Overview**

Tough Trailers (formerly Tough Steel) was founded in 2000 as an architectural metal fabricator, they diversified into small box trailer manufacturing in 2007. By 2010, the trailer business had grown so much that they made the decision to become a full-time trailer manufacturer and re-branded as "Tough Trailers".

Tough Trailers produces both standard and customized box trailers.

The factory and Head office is in Newcastle with showrooms in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

With 1500 customers and Turnover of \$10M, Tough Trailers has seen sales increase by 40% each year in the last two years.

**Customers**

Customers range from home handyman to horse owners, trade persons, serious off-roaders and a variety of motor sports people

Trailers come in a variety of styles, including small box trailer \$1,000, to utility trailers and customised trailers.

Custom trailers include horse floats, off-road, car or bike carriers in ranging from \$1,300 to over \$10,000.

The custom trailers have become more popular recently, particularly with trades persons and motor sports people.

**Problems**

The company internal systems and computer systems have worked well in the past, but with the increase in sales, they realize that they may not be able to cope with continued expansion.

The main ares of concern are:

- The Designer/Estimator liaises with Manufacturing to obtain quotes for the customised trailers.
  - Quotes for custom trailers are taking too long.
  - The customers love the unlimited design scope, but waiting on quotes from manufacturer is loosing business.

- Sales catalogues are very basic
- Showrooms only hold a limited number of demonstration items.
- There is not gallery of past custom trailers that have been built in the past.
- Customers want to be able to see more examples of the types of customised trailers that can be produced.

**Future Strategies**

- A determined push into the customised trailer market with provision for people who want some individualisation of their trailers.
- Producing a range of modular components that can be volume manufactured.
- Expand their sales outlets through the opening of dealerships, possibly using a franchise model (this has not yet been evaluated, but maybe persued later).
- Create a website to provide information about standard and customised trailers
  - Online catalogue.
  - Sell directly to customers through online ordering. 
  - Integrate with their current systems for payments.
  - Easy content management
  - Budget of \$30,000 for the website, which can be completed in two stages.

CUSTOMERS
Tough Trailers customers range from the home handyman to horse owners, trade persons, serious off-roaders and a variety of motor sports people (bike, boat and karts etc.).
Customers’ orders range from the standard small box trailer for \$1,000 to utility trailers and customised trailers.
Utility trailers include off-road trailers, car or bike carriers, and horse floats.
These can range in price from \$1,300 to over \$10,000 for the deluxe horse float.

Customised trailers have become more popular recently, particularly with trades persons and motor sports people.
Prices can range from \$3,000 up to \$9,500 depending on the customisation required.


PROBLEMS

The company internal systems and computer systems have worked well in the past, but with the increase in sales, 
Tough Trailers has realised that they may not be able to cope with continued expansion,
especially into some of the new areas that they hope to exploit.

In particular, the following problems have been experienced:
• The Designer/Estimator liaises with Manufacturing to obtain quotes for the customised trailers and is having trouble getting this 
information within a reasonable time period.
While they’re finding it valuable to be able to provide their clients with an unlimited design scope,
the time taken to get a quote from Manufacturing is losing them business.

• Customers want to be able to see more examples of the types of customised trailers that can be produced.
The sales catalogues are very basic, and the sales offices can only hold a limited number of demonstration items.
With the benefit of hind-sight it would have been a good idea to photograph each customised trailer for inclusion in a more comprehensive brochure.

FUTURE STRATEGIES
Some of the major changes in direction that arose from the strategic plan include the following:
- A determined push into the customised trailer market to provide solutions for people who want some individualisation of their trailers. This will be achieved to some extent by producing a range of modular components that can be manufactured in higher volumes rather than individually customised.
- To expand their sales outlets through the opening of dealerships. The possibility of franchising sales outlets has also been considered and this is likely to be pursuedlater.
- To create a website that’s likely to be initially used to provide information about standard and customised trailers, and eventually to sell directly to customers through online ordering. The website should integrate with their current systems forpayments.
Jenny Smith, the Office Manager, has an excellent grasp of computer applications and has been instrumental in setting up a website for her netball association using WordPress. Jenny Smith is particularly eager to get a company website up and running, with an online catalogue, ordering and payment facilities. She envisages performing routine updates of the content, either by herself or with assistance from IT. She’s looking forward to the challenge.
At this stage, Tough Trailers have decided that developing the website is beyond their experience and expertise and that Red Opal Innovations will provide this service. However, they’re keen to ensure the website is dynamic and fresh and expect to develop new content and be able to upload it to the website. They have a budget of \$30,000 for the website, which can be completed in two stages.
As a newly appointed Project Manager with Red Opal Innovations you have been asked to work with Tough Trailers to look at their strategic plan, the problems, ICT inadequacies and viable solutions.
