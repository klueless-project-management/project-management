### Tough Trailers Scenario

You have been recently appointed as a Project Manager in the Development Team with ROI.

The Head of the ROI Development Team, Terrence Stewart, has asked you to start working in collaboration with Tough Trailers to define the problems with their strategic plan and present viable solutions.

While you have access to various business documents, your primary role is to consider the existing ICT infrastructure and its inadequacies to meet current business requirements of Tough Trailers including the impact of these inadequacies.

Please note the ROI Development Team is also working on another project with Tough Trailers that relates to website development for the client. At this stage you are not part of the website development project team.  However, you have been advised to ensure that any probable impact of website development on the business is included in your work.
