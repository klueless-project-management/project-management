## Introduction

## Report body
  
### Background information

**Company Overview**

Tough Trailers (formerly Tough Steel) was founded in 2000 as an architectural metal fabricator, they diversified into small box trailer manufacturing in 2007. By 2010, the trailer business had grown so much that they made the decision to become a full-time trailer manufacturer and re-branded as "Tough Trailers".

Tough Trailers produces both standard and customized box trailers.

The factory and Head office is in Newcastle with showrooms in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

With 1500 customers and Turnover of \$10M, Tough Trailers has seen sales increase by 40% each year in the last two years.

**Customers**

Customers range from home handyman to horse owners, trade persons, serious off-roaders and a variety of motor sports people

Trailers come in a variety of styles, including small box trailer \$1,000, to utility trailers and customised trailers.

Custom trailers include horse floats, off-road, car or bike carriers in ranging from \$1,300 to over \$10,000.

The custom trailers have become more popular recently, particularly with trades persons and motor sports people.

**Problems**

The company internal systems and computer systems have worked well in the past, but with the increase in sales, they realize that they may not be able to cope with continued expansion.

The main ares of concern are:

- The Designer/Estimator liaises with Manufacturing to obtain quotes for the customised trailers.
  - Quotes for custom trailers are taking too long.
  - The customers love the unlimited design scope, but waiting on quotes from manufacturer is loosing business.

- Sales catalogues are very basic
- Showrooms only hold a limited number of demonstration items.
- There is not gallery of past custom trailers that have been built in the past.
- Customers want to be able to see more examples of the types of customised trailers that can be produced.

**Future Strategies**

- A determined push into the customised trailer market with provision for people who want some individualisation of their trailers.
- Producing a range of modular components that can be volume manufactured.
- Expand their sales outlets through the opening of dealerships, possibly using a franchise model (this has not yet been evaluated, but maybe persued later).
- Create a website to provide information about standard and customised trailers
  - Online catalogue.
  - Sell directly to customers through online ordering. 
  - Integrate with their current systems for payments.
  - Easy content management
  - Budget of \$30,000 for the website, which can be completed in two stages.

### Current Strategic Plan

### Current Business Requirement

The existing Tough Trailers business has a head office is in Newcastle with showrooms in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and turnover \$10M.

Our broad goal is to grow our 1500 customer base, double our sales over 5 years and grow revenue (retained profits) by 15% per year in 5 years.

We have two core strategies that we are focused on to achieve these goals:

1. Modernise our IT systems
   - Create online sales and marketing systems (via website)
   - Staff training, development and compliance.
   - Product/catalogue management system
   - Virtual tools for designers and bespoke customizations.
   - eCommerce portal to self direct to customers
   - VR Goggles in showrooms to view trailer concepts.
   - Sales and communication tools (faster quote, better followup)
2. Modular Component Manufacturing
   - Increase production capacity
   - Upgrade the existing process of prefab manufacturing to modular manufacturing
   - Support a range of trailer bases, industry specific components and generalized accessories
     - This is to lesson the cumbersome individual customizations that we currently do.
     - [Reference: Examples](https://www.modularcomponents.com.au/)
   - Volume produce modular components, and/or
   - In-line 3D facility to print components for just in time turn around and/or component prototypes
   - Integrate IT in this process
     - Brochures / Catalogues
     - Inventory Management
     - CAD Design Tools
     - DIY Online Design Tools
     - Custom Colour Schemes and Visualizations

An additional requirement (outside of the core strategies) will be these three areas of concern:

1. How can we grow the business? "Franchising and Dealerships" plus other options to be explored
4. How do we maintaining production / manufacturing capacity? Can we meet market demands using explore prefab, modular and/or 3D print production lines.
5. What is the best product fit for the ever changing market? Explore diversification options and new types of trailer markets such as Grey Travel and Digital Nomads.

**What is modular type?** *Modular design, or modularity in design, is a design principle that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules (such as modular process skids), which can be independently created, modified, replaced, or exchanged with other modules or between different systems.*

### Current ICT System

Tough Trailers has four locations (Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane) each with standard Windows Based LAN.

There is no centralized server, they are managed independently and upgraded as needed.

All white-color staff (office/sales) have access to desktop or laptop computer running Windows 10

None of the desktops, laptops or networks are running virus projection and there is no network firewall or security policy and most machines are mid-range and a few years old.

The blue-color staff (manufacturing) only use shared computing resources. 1 PC for head of manufacturing and 2 PCs for 16 workers (welders and fitters)

**Custom software**

- SalesTRAC for Sales department
- AutoCAD for Designers, Estimaters and manufacturing (Fitters/Welders)

**Custom hardware**

- General purpose printers at each location
- Departmental printers for sales, admin and Finance
- Large multipurpose printer for Manufacturing
- The managing director and head of HR are high end hardware

**Weakness in Current ICT System:**

> - Insecure
> - Costly to maintain
> - Does not support scalability if the workforce grows.
> - Decentralized and so not easily managed from central location.

## Appraisal of current gap analysis technique

### SWOT  Analysis

|**Threats**| - Finding Skilled Workers<br> - Communication Systems<br> - Moral and Training | - Strong price oriented online competitors (especially via Amazon)<br> - Currency fluctuation/s mean we should not hold too much stock (JIT Manufacturing schedule may be solution)<br> - Legislative changes need to be transferred to staff |

### Business weaknesses or inadequacies

The core manufacturing business revolves around standard build templates and when a customization is needed, the designers, fitters and welder draw on past experience to deliver a bespoke solution each time.

- Manufacturing could see greatly increased effectiveness by taking on 3D and Modular manufacturing techniques.
- Existing staff are not skilled in new production line processes
- Custom designs have a long build and deliver schedule

The sales and marketing side of the business uses expensive and somewhat outdated practices.

- Showrooms are a major expense and only service local regions
- Catalogues only have standard products (not customisations)
- Custom designs require access to in-person designer

Little presence in the online space.

- Missing opportunities for a large number of interstate, regional and online savvy customers
- New designs and customizations cannot be displayed via online portal
- No access to bloggers or influencers (they tend to write or share about online systems)

No Vertical Integration

- Isolated LANs - A lack of centralised ITC infrastructure across manufacturing, sales, office (HR, Training, Ops)
  - Systems are Siloed.
  - Operations cannot see SalesTRAC
  - Sales People cannot see or use AutoCAD.
- Lack of SASS or On Premise systems that can talk to each other. 
  - CRM (Accounts, Help Desk)
  - Sales, Marketing (eCommerce, SMS/Email Marketing, Online Portal)
  - CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Manufacturing)
- Support
  - Hard to do remote support
  - Hard to upgrade the entire company
  - Security concerns
