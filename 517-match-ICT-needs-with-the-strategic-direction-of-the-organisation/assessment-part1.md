## Scenario based question


### Go-Air scenario
Go-Air is a small no frills airline with a fleet of 22 aircrafts.  It started in 2007 as a low-cost budget carrier and had been the top airline in its category.  The strategic plan 2014-2018 struggled to meet its objectives due to increased competition, lack of a customer loyalty program (that other low-cost carriers offer), increasing frequency of flight delays and customer dissatisfaction.  

Go-Air management board has decided to carry out a major review of the business strategy for the next 5-year strategic plan (2019-2023).  As a senior ICT manager you have been asked to provide advice in preparing the next strategic plan as it relates to current and future ICT systems.

### **Questions**
1. As a senior ICT manager outline what would be your first step in this scenario? (Hint: Think about gaining better understanding of the existing strategic plan and current business practices). 50-75 words

- Review documents and question staff on what propelled the company to become a top budget airline from year 2007 to 2013
- Review the 2014/2018 strategic plan, look at it's assumptions, it's deliverables and KPI's
- Read up and get a sense of the market forces that were in effect 2007-2013 vs 2014 - 2018.
- Review the new competitors in the market

2. In the current strategic plan review, you have determined that there needs to be a significant investment in ICT systems. The introduction of a customer loyalty program is one area that would have impact on ICT systems and consequently the Go-Air business. 
   
  
  ICT can stream line Go-Air in the following areas
  
  **Customer loyalty**
  
  - Loyalty Program
  - Reservations
  - Customer support, FAQ and status updates
  - Logistics (such as where is my bag)

  Customer Loyalty can be implemented using each of these systems.

  - A loyalty program can reward repeat customers or customers who refer other people
  - A loyalty program can incentivize via partner programs
  - Reservations can be automated for quicker flight on-board and reduced waiting times
  - Customer Support and FAQ systems can answer repeat questions quickly
  - Customers should be able to see the status of flights, availability and baggage through automated systems

3. Based on your answer in question 2 above, describe your advice to the Go-Air management regarding changes to ICT systems to accommodate a customer loyalty program? 50-75 words

- Add an LMS (Loyalty Management System)
  - Implement a Loyalty Program
  - Suggestions & Feedback
  - Integrate with partner systems
- Build personal and public dashboards for customer & staff
  - Flight schedules, delays
  - Promotions
  - Seat allocations
  - Baggage locations
- FAQ and Support
  - Create a rich searchable FAQ
  - Online access to support Ticketing

4. Outline your justification to Go-Air management for an increase in ICT related costs associated with the introduction of a customer loyalty program?

  - Loyalty Program
    - Increase revenue via repeat customers because of lower prices or benefits that they receive.
    - Lock these customers away from competitors
  - FAQ and Support tools will build up the company a knowledge base so that staff (new and old) will be more efficient
  - Dashboards will reduce customer service enquires and empower our customers.
 
5. Based on the information provided in the Go-Air scenario, describe what other advice you have for the Go-Air management for the 2019-2023 Strategic Plan regarding ICT systems?

  - LMS (Loyalty Management System)
    - Easy to lock in our existing customers to using Go-Air vs a competitor
    - Provides a channel for new promotions

  - Personal and public dashboards
    - Will cut costs associated with
      - Flight schedules, delay queries
      - Promotions
      - Automating seat allocations
      - Locating baggage

6. Implementing a customer loyalty program will mean significant changes to current ICT systems. Outline an action plan to implement this change. 


- Choose off the shelf LMS or build our own
- Any LMS system we got with will need integrations with our existing CMS (Customer Management System)
- The LMS will need to be keep track of customer purchases (aka flights)
- Marketing will need to define 1 or more loyalty programs
- If there is a plan to integrate loyalty with partner systems then;
  - We will need a person who's responsibility is to liaise with partners
  - Integrations with partner systems will be bespoke and have various development costs associated

- **KPI**: Related to the LMS implementation should include:
  - Repeat customer purchases
  - Increase in click through rates for new targeted promotion 
  - Increased revenue
  - Understanding of the long term value of a customer
  - Understanding of the cost of acquisition for new customers

7 . Implementing the customer loyalty program will involve some difficulties for both ICT systems and Go-Air business as a whole.

- Promblem1: How easy will it be to create bespoke integrations with our CMS and Logistics platforms. Plus integration with partners
- Promblem2: New roles and responsibilities will need to be created in the marketing department related to loyalty programs and partnership relationships.
