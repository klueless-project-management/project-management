### **Step 2.4 – Current Business Requirements** 
Using the information obtained from Steps 1 and 2, write a summary** of the current business requirements for Tough Trailers under the heading **Current Business Requirements** in your report.  

You will be required to:

- Identify Key Stakeholders (business stakeholders as well as the project stakeholders). In this case stakeholders are not individuals but major groups that are internal and external to the business e.g. Manufacturing, Customers, ROI etc.
- Categorise stakeholders as Internal or External

Table  SEQ Table \\* ARABIC 2 Business Requirements template 

|**Current business requirements – Tough Trailers**|
| - |
|**Key Stakeholders**|**Category**|**Requirements**|**Interpretation**|
|Manufacturing|Internal |<p>- Production capacity</p><p>- In-line 3D printing facility</p><p>- Training and development</p><p>- New technologies</p><p>- Improved communication with sales staff for faster quote procedures</p><p>- Modular components development</p>|<p>- With the website development, sales boost is expected.</p><p>- Current production capacity is just enough – how will the increased sales be translated into actual manufacturing with no delays.</p><p>- In-line 3D printing facility can significantly reduce design prototype development time.</p><p>- Moving into modular components development can reduce quote times for sales staff and they can themselves demonstrate various design options using the integrated manufacturing – sales section of the website. </p><p>- Employees need training and competence to new technologies and capacity building</p>|

### **Step 3.1 – SWOT Analysis**
Refer back to the document **Strategic Plan – Tough Trailers.** 

Tough Trailers have carried out their own SWOT analysis, but it is not as detailed as it should be.  Your SWOT Analysis however, should focus on ICT requirements and consider internal and external factors for all four components of SWOT. You will need to consider stakeholders, their requirements and the business requirements.

|**Weaknesses**|- Lack of training|- Substandard information brochures (for customers)|
|**Opportunities**|||
|**Threats**|||

### **Step 3.2 – Business weaknesses or inadequacies**
Using the information completed in Step 2, list and briefly summarise the business weaknesses or inadequacies, both internal and external, relating to ICT.  This summary will identify the existing gaps in the current business (weaknesses) and what it should be (improvement opportunities).  

Include this information under the heading **Business weaknesses or inadequacies** in your report. *(Approximately 250 words)*


## **Part 4: Impact statement**
### **Step 4.1 – Impact on Tough Trailers business**
To complete this part of the assessment, you will be required to refer back to the **business weaknesses or inadequacies**, completed in Part 3 Step 3.3 above.  

For each weakness that you have identified above, describe the impact on Tough Trailers business.  

Include this information under the heading **Impact on Tough Trailers business** in your report. *(Approximately 500 words)*

For example:

- Poor coordination: Current systems do not allow in time responses by the Estimator to a potential customer.  This can result in probable loss of business to competitors.



**Part 5: Gain progress approval**

This part of the assessment will be completed in class as a role play.  Your Assessor will guide you through the role play process.  Please refer to following **Observation checklist 1** to help prepare yourself for this task.

*Terrence is already familiar with the background of the Tough Trailers situation, has read your report and wishes to meet with you to clarify some details before giving approval to progress to the next stage.*

*The agenda items for this informal meeting are as follows:* 

1. *Review of work to date*
1. *Directions forward*

In this meeting your assessor will organise for a suitable person, such as another teacher, student or industry representative, to play the role of your manager, the Head of the ROI Development Team, Terrence Stewart. 

This role play will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
