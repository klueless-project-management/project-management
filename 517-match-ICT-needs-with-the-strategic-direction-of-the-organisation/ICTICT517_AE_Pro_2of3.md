**Part 2: Propose Changes and Evaluate the Effect of Changes**

You will be required to carry out the following seven steps to complete this part of the assessment.

### **Step 2.1 – Background information**
For this part of the assessment you need to review the work you completed in the previous assessment **Project Assessment 1**.

Briefly describe why changes are required to the Tough Trailers’ current ICT systems? 

Include this information under the heading **Background information** in your report. *(Approximately 150 words)*

### **Step 2.2 – Current ICT network and hardware**
For this part of the assessment you need to review the work you completed in the previous assessment **Project Assessment 1** and the **Existing ICT Resources – Tough Trailers** document.

***From this point on you will focus on the upgrade of the existing Tough Trailers ICT setup into an integrated network structure. The development of the Tough Trailers website does not need to be considered.***

*Currently the Tough Trailers business have 22 desktop computers, 21 business laptops and 6 printers. The departments are connected within themselves but not to each other and they do not have a centralised network or one access point for the entire network.*

Using networking diagram drawing software, prepare a network diagram that demonstrates the existing ICT setup at Tough Trailers. This diagram will include the current network as well as any additional hardware so that the diagram represents the entire situation.

Include this diagram under the heading **Current ICT network and hardware** in your report. 


### **Step 2.3 – Research task –  Possible technologies**
This step requires you to complete online research. 

Investigate possible technologies and associated costs to upgrade the existing Tough Trailers ICT setup into an integrated network structure.  Technologies you may wish to consider include:

- Virtualisation
- Cloud computing
- Zero Clients or “dumb terminals”
- Browser based operating systems e.g. Chromebooks
- Wireless POA
- BYOD 
- Any combination of these.

Use the following **Table 2** **Possible Technologies** to document your research findings in point form. *(Approximately 300 words).* 

Table  SEQ Table \\* ARABIC 2 Possible Technologies

|**Technology**|**URL (s)**|**Research Findings**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Virtualisation|||
||||
||||
||||
||||
||||
||||

### **Step 2.4 – Identify suitable options**
Based on your technologies research in Step 2.3 above and your understanding of the Tough Trailers scenario, identify and briefly describe three possible options to upgrade the existing Tough Trailers ICT setup into an integrated network structure. These options may involve a combination of technologies. 

In your option description you need to:

- Briefly describe the possible option
- Identify the technologies used
- List specific hardware, software, networking etc. requirements e.g. number and type of routers, switches, servers, virtualisation software etc. 

Be aware that desktop and laptop replacement will occur at regular (for example 3 years replacement) with ongoing maintenance (6 monthly batch-update program).

Document your answer using **Table 3 Suitable options template** below, and include this in your report under the heading **Suitable options**. *(Approximately 150 words)*

Hint: Your options do not have to be radically different from each other and may only involve variations of only one or two elements.

` `Table  SEQ Table \\* ARABIC 3 Suitable options template

|**Option**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|1||
|2||
|3||


### **Step 2.5 – Cost suitable options**
Calculate probable initial and per annum costs for each option you have identified above in Step 2.4. These costs may be Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimates also known as guesstimates. Cost estimates should be realistic, but you are not required to present exact costs.

Document your answer using **Table 4 Options Costings template** below and include this in your report under the heading **Options costings**. *(Approximately 150 words)*

Table  SEQ Table \\* ARABIC 4 Options Costings template

|**Option**|**Costing**|
| :- | :- |
|1||
|2||
|3||

### **Step 2.6 – Options comparison**
For this part of the assessment you need to use **ICT Expense Summary – Tough Trailers** document as a basis for your comparison.

For each option you have identified in **Step 2.4**:

1. Describe its advantages and disadvantages 
1. Compare the option with the current Tough Trailers ICT setup (both technically and cost-wise)
1. Identify any anticipated problems or difficulties that may be encountered in the Tough Trailers workplace if the option is implemented. 

Enter your answer under the heading **Options comparison** in your report.  *(Approximately 500 words)* 

Hint: Some common problems that may occur when a change is introduced are resistance to change; need for training and mis-matching technology.


### **Step 2.7 – Preferred option**
Based on the information you have compiled in the previous steps, identify and justify your preferred option. 

To justify your preferred option compare it to the other identified options and the current Tough Trailers ICT setup. Your comparison should take into consideration its advantages and disadvantages, technical and costs aspects as well as impacts of implementation. You may use tables to present your answer.

Using networking diagram drawing software, prepare a network diagram that demonstrates the preferred option and include this with your answer. You do not need to prepare a networking diagram for all identified options.

Enter your answer under the heading **Preferred option** in your report. *(Approximately 350 words + diagram)*

### **2.8 – Impact of change**
Describe the impact of change if your preferred option was accepted and implemented by Tough Trailers. 

To evaluate the impact of change you will need to answer the question: How does this option change the existing Tough Trailers ICT setup and how will such changes affect the current ICT and business practices at Tough Trailers.  List and describe at least four possible impacts.

Include your description under the heading **Impact of proposed change** in your report. *(Approximately 350 words)*
