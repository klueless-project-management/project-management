### Question 1.1

1. Define what the client business domain is and explain why it is important for the project team when trying to understand the business needs?

The Business Domain refers to real-world aspects of your solution, it is made up of the language, lingo and meanings that relate specifically to the business industry (e.g. Healthcare, Aviation, Finance, Military, Retail, etc). 

The business domain will guide your requirements and acceptance criteria for the system. You come to understand the business domain by talking to domain experts (aka workers within the business)


3. List four (4) questions you might ask to define a clientâ€™s business domain.

What are the different domains within the business, (e.g. accounting department, logistics department, warehouse)
What are common words or phrases and their meanings that are spoke by people within the business
Are there terms that are used in different parts of the business that have different meaning or context, (e.g. is the term client in the sales department the same as the term client in the stock inventory department)
Who is an expert that I can talk to and come to understand the workflows and processes that they use

4. Explain why you have chosen these questions.

To develop a solution that meets business requirements, it has to:

- Asking about the different domains helps to establish domain boundaries and what domain context is primarily responsible for certain information.
- Use Nouns that people in that part of the business understand. You might have a Catalogue in the Sales Department and a Inventory Category in the warehouse department and they hold the same information but the meaning is different.
- Word definitions are required because a manifest in the freight forwarding department is different to a manifest in the Software Development department.
- Talking to the domain expert (worker) about how they do there task will elicit all sorts of information on requirements, constraints, nouns, what shold be in scope/out of scope.

### Question 1.2

1. Explain the role of stakeholders in the information gathering process. 

Stakeholder (Sponsor) - The sponsor may or may not work in the business but they do hold the purse strings, this person may not tell you much about the business, but they will tell you where you can invest in resources and what is expected as an outcome form the investment.
Stakeholder (Primary) - This stakeholder wants/needs the solution that this project is to deliver, they see the completion of this project having a positive impact on their own KPI's
Stakeholder (Internal) - These stakeholders will be affected by the project, they want input into the requirements so that they see a positive side affect for their own KPI's or productivity.
Stakeholder (External) - These stakeholders will be affected by the project and so their is important, but they not part of the business (customers, venders, partners) or it is another internal department with minimal connection to the project.

2. When gathering information how much involvement should there be with the stakeholders?

This various on a case by case basis.

Most of the involvement is likely to be with the primary stakeholder.
The project sponsor may need a lot of involvement, or they might just need a quick interview on their expectations plus summary reports on progress.
Internal stakeholders who will be effected should be heard, interviewed, questioned, but it not generally as much as the project sponsor.
External stakeholders should be questioned, interviewed (or read the support tickets and correspondence from them) so that you can advocate business decisions from their point of view. But this can be minimal involvement.

### Question 1.3

Research and evaluate two (2) examples of quality assurance practices that would be required when determining business requirements. 
Make sure you include PDCA as one quality assurance practice in your answer. 


The PDCA is a continuous loop of Planning, Doing, Checking and Acting. It provides a simple and effective approach for solving problems and managing change. 
The model is useful for testing improvement measures on a small scale before updating procedures and working practices.
When using PDCA, it means your company is constantly improving


DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) is a data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes.
- Define the problem, improvement activity, opportunity for improvement, the project goals, and customer (internal and external) requirements.
- Measure process performance.
- Analyze the process to determine root causes of variation and poor performance (defects).
- Improve process performance by addressing and eliminating the root causes.
- Control the improved process and future process performance.
