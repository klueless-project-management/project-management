### Step 2.7 –  Research  

##### Scenario

*One major aspect of the project relates to using a new server to host the existing servers in a virtual environment. Your manager, Terrence Stewart Network Manager and IT Support, has asked you to research possible servers that would be suitable for this business requirement.*

*Hosting the existing servers in a virtual environment will require virtualisation software. Terrence has also asked you to research possible virtualisation software that would be suitable for this business requirement.*

*Terrence would also like to know how long it will take for the company to recoup the cost of a $30,000 new server. It is estimated that the saving from implementing the new server will be an average of $10,000 per year.* 

*ROI Management would like to compare investing the $30,000 in a new server with investing the $30,000 in a term deposit. This term deposit would be for 5 years with an interest rates of 3% compound.*



1) Conduct research into new current industry accepted host servers. Include two (2) different servers in your results, describing the general features and capabilities suited to the project. Explain how the general features and capabilities each server will meet the business requirement.

Include your all your research information sources in the References box below using APA referencing style. Include at least two (2) references for each chosen server.

Use the following table to document your answer. *(Approx. 200 words)*
