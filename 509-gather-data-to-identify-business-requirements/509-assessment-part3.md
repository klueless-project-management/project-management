**Meeting results**

The current infrastructure is an internal network architecture using 5 servers.

With the move to the new location, we are going to provide an expansion path that replaces Domain Controller Server with new virtualizing technologies that are scalable with your planned business growth

The new virtualisation servers will host the existing servers and have easy expansion capability. In-house and external connections will be 10 times faster then existing setup using FTTP (fibre to the premises). Mobile work environments will be available over a secure VPN allowing remote staff to access the network whilst maintaining high security.

Budget: $150,000
