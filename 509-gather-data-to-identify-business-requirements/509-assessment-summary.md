## ROI_Scenario_add_info_1.pdf

During the first seven years of operation, the company experienced a steady growth of 5-10% per year. 

As new staff members were employed, and as the IT Support team at ROI is small, computers were added as needed on an ad hoc basis. 

In the last few years, ROI has experienced a stronger growth of 20-30% per year and has become very profitable. As a consequence, the information technology infrastructure has become outdated and is not coping well with the growth of the organisation.

This infrastructure consists of five separate physical servers, each with an assigned role(s). All servers connect directly to a gigabit network switch that connects to the local area network (LAN).

The proxy/firewall server is connected directly to the edge router, which connects to the Internet Service Provider (ISP).

ROI currently has a Telstra Bizessentials plan for broadband Internet.

All servers are required to be documented in the Network Server Register, including a network diagram.

Red Opal Innovations (ROI) is expanding and moving to a new location. To allow for the expansion, they need to replace the Domain Controller Server with a view to virtualising the server (this will mean that you need to ensure that it’s powerful enough).

ROI plans to use the new server to host the existing servers in a virtual environment.

The new premises has NBN and FTTP (fibre to the premises) available.

ROI would like to have a mobile work environment – employees may be required to work at the client’s location, work in small teams within the office in different locations, or they may be working by themselves.

ROI’s workstations are currently using a Windows 8.1 environment and use development software including Adobe Creative Cloud, which will remain unchanged.

The budget for this project is $150,000. This should cover the new server, the network infrastructure and workstations.
