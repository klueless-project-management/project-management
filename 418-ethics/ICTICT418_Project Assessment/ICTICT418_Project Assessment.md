## **Specific task instructions**
In your role as IT Trainee at [*DataTrust](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/file/22c51ecc-efca-455e-a7f2-18847749f30c/1/dataTrust.zip/dataTrust/index.html)*,* you’ve completed some preliminary research on copyright, privacy and ethics. Now you’ve been asked to make some suggestions for additions to the policies, as well as how they’ll be implemented and monitored.
## **Part 1: Update policies and procedures**
Use the [*DataTrust report template*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/integ/gen/4e2424f3-024d-4bf1-b865-206ea679190e/0/?attachment.uuid=97126431-fc49-4605-8cce-3c5dc36ecb99) (DT\_Report.dotx) to write the following policies and procedures (minimum 50 maximum 200 words each).
1.
1. 1. First, the copyright statement needs to be expanded into a copyright policy covering the whole organisation. Write a clause for the copyright policy dealing specifically with the responsibility of DataTrust employees towards copyright and intellectual property within the organisation. The clause must align with legislation and industry standards (list the relevant legislation and industry standards).
1. 1. Outline the procedures (in point form) that DataTrust employees must follow in order to apply the copyright policy, ensuring that they’re ethical.
1. 1. Previously you looked at how well DataTrust’s privacy policy covers APP 11. What amendments can you suggest to the privacy policy regarding storage and security of personal information, to make sure it aligns with privacy legislation? (List the relevant legislation). 
1. 1. Outline the physical and operating system security procedures and features (in point form) as recommendations to be implemented or enhanced, to complement your privacy policy amendments.
1. 1. DataTrust doesn’t have a code of ethics so you’ll need to develop one. Write at least two points for a code of ethics that align to legislation and industry standards (list the relevant legislation and industry standards).
1. 1. Along with the new code of ethics, management needs a grievance procedure (this should include a review process) to enable confidential reporting of any ethical issues. Write a procedure (in point form) that could be followed for this.
1. 1. Develop an implementation and review plan that DataTrust could use to ensure that the policies will be effectively employed by its staff members, including regular checks and reviews of work practices. This must include the following:
1. 1. List timeframes to implement the plan
1. 1. Outline three appropriate methods and processes to communicate the policies and procedures to staff members and clients (the stakeholders).


## **Part 2: Present the policies and procedures (Date of Presentation: Check on the Moodle)**
Participate in a class presentation (minimum three and maximum 5 minutes, including assessor questions) to verbally discuss your copyright, privacy and ethics policies and procedures (from Part 1) in a meeting with DataTrust staff members. This will take place during your class on the specified date**.**

Ensure that you include the following in your presentation:

1. Distribute your policies and procedures either electronically, for example, as a PowerPoint presentation using the [*DataTrust PowerPoint template*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/integ/gen/4e2424f3-024d-4bf1-b865-206ea679190e/0/?attachment.uuid=7cc3a2a4-d8d0-44f8-acde-2590be004652) (DT\_Powerpoint.potx), or as a printed document using the [*DataTrust report template*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/integ/gen/4e2424f3-024d-4bf1-b865-206ea679190e/0/?attachment.uuid=97126431-fc49-4605-8cce-3c5dc36ecb99) (DT\_Report.dotx), as appropriate.
1. Clearly explain your clause for the Copyright Policy, including the procedures that employees will need to follow.
1. Clearly explain your amendments for the Privacy Policy, including the system security procedures that employees will need to follow.
1. Clearly explain your two points for the Code of Ethics.
1. Clearly explain your grievance procedure.
1. Outline the implementation plan.
1. Ask your audience for feedback on the policies and procedures. If no one has any general feedback, you must ask specific questions.
1. **Your assessor will ask you additional questions relevant to the scenario.**


## **Part 3: Monitor policies and procedures**
The new DataTrust Privacy Policy and Code of Ethics have recently been implemented, however there have still been several breaches within DataTrust. 

Requirements have also been established under the Privacy Act for entities in responding to data breaches, known as the [Notifiable Data Breaches](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/notifiable-data-breaches-scheme) (NDB) scheme, which DataTrust is obliged to abide by.

You’ve been asked to monitor the implementation of DataTrust’s Privacy Policy and Code of Ethics by following up with two clients who have been affected by data breaches, as well as report to your supervisor on the outcome of your review.
1.
1. 1. The CIO, Mark Thrift received a complaint from a client, Tricia Portman. Tricia called the Accounts section to query an invoice and spoke to Brian Cotswald. Brian went on to disclose her personal information without having verified her identify.

Tricia sees this as a breach of privacy and is very upset that the DataTrust Privacy Policy has not been adhered to by Brian. 

You’ve been asked to follow up with Tricia, so you’ll need to review the [*DataTrust* *Privacy Policy*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/integ/gen/4e2424f3-024d-4bf1-b865-206ea679190e/0/?attachment.uuid=ed60ff9d-7d97-4ddf-ac86-c6b2bf5b569d) (Privacy Policy.pdf).
1.
1. Write an email to Tricia, using the [*email template*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/integ/gen/4e2424f3-024d-4bf1-b865-206ea679190e/0/?attachment.uuid=43ae944e-a12f-42bb-8925-f33e381cbfb6) (DT\_Email.dotx), as follows (minimum 75 and maximum 200 words):
1.
1. 1. Thank Tricia for her feedback, explaining how it will be used to assist the organisation
1. 1. Outline DataTrust’s requirements that should have been followed, according to the Privacy Policy, to ensure good customer service.
