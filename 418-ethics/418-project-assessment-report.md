## Specific task instructions

In your role as IT Trainee at [DataTrust](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/file/22c51ecc-efca-455e-a7f2-18847749f30c/1/dataTrust.zip/dataTrust/index.html)*,* you’ve completed some preliminary research on copyright, privacy and ethics. Now you’ve been asked to make some suggestions for additions to the policies, as well as how they’ll be implemented and monitored.

### Part 1: Update policies and procedures

> 1. The copyright statement needs to be expanded into a copyright policy covering the whole organisation. Write a clause for the copyright policy dealing specifically with the responsibility of DataTrust employees towards copyright and intellectual property within the organisation. The clause must align with legislation and industry standards (list the relevant legislation and industry standards).

**Copyright Statement**

We at DataTrust recognize and respect intellectual property rights and are committed to fulfilling our moral and legal obligations with respect to our use of copyright-protected works.

No employee of DataTrust may reproduce any copyrighted work in print, video or digital form in violation of the law. Works are considered protected even if they are not registered with the U.S. Copyright Office or any registering agency outside the U.S. and even if they do not carry the copyright symbol (©). Copyrighted works include, but are not limited to: printed articles from publications, electronic articles in online publications, online videos, movies, TV and radio programs, recorded music performances, images, training materials, manuals, documentation, software programs, databases, websites and blogs. In general, the laws that apply to printed materials also apply to visual and digital formats such as websites, streaming media, music downloads, mobile apps, CDs and DVDs.

To obtain permission to reproduce copyrighted works outside of DataTrust and/or to use such works in ways that are not covered by our license or other prior agreements, employees should request permission by contacting our copyright officer at DataTrust@dmail.com

[See Copyright](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip-for-digital-business/develop/copyright)
[See Laws and Regulations by section in the Act](https://iclg.com/practice-areas/copyright-laws-and-regulations/australia)


> 2. Outline the procedures (in point form) that DataTrust employees must follow in order to apply the copyright policy, ensuring that they’re ethical.

- New employees need to be made aware of the company’s copyright policy and to receive ongoing reinforcement thereafter so information isn’t forgotten or outdated.
- Training should focus on specific use cases, so employees understand the granular aspects of their company policy. Example scenarios: If your company has just been featured in an influential trade journal, can the article be copied and sent to a small group of coworkers?
- DataTrust employee can request permission from DataTrust copyright officer at DataTrust@dmail.com
- DataTrust employees are encouraged to educate their peers on copyright compliance.
- DataTrust employees who witnesses a potential copyright infringement, should bring the matter to the attention of the individual as well as to our the copyright officer at DataTrust@dmail.com

> 3. Previously you looked at how well DataTrust’s privacy policy covers APP 11. What amendments can you suggest to the privacy policy regarding storage and security of personal information, to make sure it aligns with privacy legislation? (List the relevant legislation).

**11.8 - data breaches**

DataTrust should add a section that deals with what to do if a data breach occurs.

**11.19 - Unauthorised modification**

DataTrust has an authentication mechanisms in place, meaning we know who can and cant access the system. But there is no record or audit of changes so we don't know if secure information is altered.

> 4. Outline the physical and operating system security procedures and features (in point form) as recommendations to be implemented or enhanced, to complement your privacy policy amendments.

DataTrust needs to develop a procedure that the compliance officer should follow in case of a data breach.
DataTrust needs to provide audit trails related to any secure information that is stored in our databases, these audit trails should include who changed the data, plus before/after change.

> 5. DataTrust doesn’t have a code of ethics so you’ll need to develop one. Write at least two points for a code of ethics that align to legislation and industry standards (list the relevant legislation and industry standards).

**Code of Ethics**

Based on: Integrity, Objectivity, Professional competence and due care, Confidentiality, and Professional behaviour.

This Code of Conduct applies to all people at DataTrust.

- Permanent Employees
- Fixed Term Employees
- Casual Employees
- Contractors/ Consultants

The Following the Code of Conduct is critical to being a part of the DataTrust team.

- The principles and polices outlined and referred to in this Code of Conduct are very important
and failure to follow them could lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
your employment.

If you are ever unsure about what to do, ask yourself:
- Is it legal?
- Does it feel right?
- Will my action stand the test of time?
- How would I feel about it afterwards?
- How would it look on the front page of the newspaper?
- Could I justify it to my family?

If the answer is ‘no’ or ‘I’m not sure’ to any of these questions, then you should seek support. You can speak to your manager or any other DataTrust colleague that you trust- they might be able to give you the guidance and advice you need.

> 6. Along with the new code of ethics, management needs a grievance procedure (this should include a review process) to enable confidential reporting of any ethical issues. Write a procedure (in point form) that could be followed for this.

At DataTrust, Employees can file grievances for any of the following reasons:

- Workplace harassment
- Health and safety
- Supervisor behavior
- Adverse changes in employment conditions

Employees are encouraged to talk to each other to resolve their problems. When this isn’t possible, employees can follow these procedures to file a grievance:

- Communicate informally with your direct supervisor. The supervisor will try to resolve the problem. 
- If you wish to complain about your supervisor, you should seek support from HR department who will guide you through the procedures to take.

The HR department should follow the procedure below:

- Ask employee to fill out a grievance form
- Talk with the employee to ensure the matter is understood completely
- Provide the employee who faces allegations with a copy of the grievance
- Organize mediation procedures (e.g. arranging a formal meeting)
- Investigate the matter or ask the help of an investigator when needed
- Keep employees informed throughout the process
- Communicate the formal decision to all employees involved
- Take actions to ensure the formal decision is adhered to
- Deal with appeals by gathering more information and investigating further
- Keep accurate records

> 7. Develop an implementation and review plan that DataTrust could use to ensure that the policies will be effectively employed by its staff members, including regular checks and reviews of work practices. This must include the following:



## Part 3: Monitor policies and procedures

1. The CIO, Mark Thrift received a complaint from a client, Tricia Portman. Tricia called the Accounts section to query an invoice and spoke to Brian Cotswald. Brian went on to disclose her personal information without having verified her identify.

Tricia sees this as a breach of privacy and is very upset that the DataTrust Privacy Policy has not been adhered to by Brian. 

You’ve been asked to follow up with Tricia, so you’ll need to review the [*DataTrust* *Privacy Policy*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/integ/gen/4e2424f3-024d-4bf1-b865-206ea679190e/0/?attachment.uuid=ed60ff9d-7d97-4ddf-ac86-c6b2bf5b569d) (Privacy Policy.pdf).

Write an email to Tricia, using the [*email template*](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/integ/gen/4e2424f3-024d-4bf1-b865-206ea679190e/0/?attachment.uuid=43ae944e-a12f-42bb-8925-f33e381cbfb6) (DT\_Email.dotx), as follows (minimum 75 and maximum 200 words):

Dear Tricia,

I'm sorry to hear about your experience with our Accounts Representative 'Brian Cotswald'.

I have checked our privacy policy and our procedure manual around identity checks and will follow up with both Brian and the entire Accounts Team with training around this particular scenario.

Thank you for notifying DataTrust about this issue.

Kind regards

**FOLLOWUP with Supervisor**

Subject: Disclosing Personal Information without appropriate checks

Hi Sue Supervisor,

We have had a information disclosure breach by one of the staff in the Accounts Department.

I will followup with that person directly, but I have reviewed our Privacy Policy and noticed that while we have provision for not disclosing information unless needed, we don't seem to have information about identity checks.

- I will update the privacy policy with a paragraph on this issue
- We will also need to writeup a procedure for dealing with identity checks from customers before disclosing private information
- We will need to implement some training around this for Accounts and any other teams you deem necessary.

Kind regards
David Cruwys
